### Getting Started (Development)

- First you must have a *node.js* installed locally on your machine.

- Clone the project on your machine, and run `npm install` from root directory to install app dependencies.

- Then run `npm run dev` from root directory and it will run the server on `http://localhost:5173`.

#### Architecture

Form `src` directory:

- `/components` holds all reusable components (Items, SearchInput... etc).
- `/Hooks` stores custom hooks.
- `/layout` contains layout components for the app (Header, Footer, Sidebar,...etc).

`routes.js` routes file to place any routes for the application.
